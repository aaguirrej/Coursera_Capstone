# Coursera IBM Coursera Data Science Capstone Final Report

### Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.

Problem: What type of restuarant to open in Downtown Toronto depending on the neighborhood? In order to open a restaurant of a certain type the idea is to explore the existing restaurants in the different Downtown Toronto's Neighborhoods. This will be based on restaurant types (i.e. Mexican, Sushi, French) available in each neighborhood and on ratings, price range and social activity of regular restaurant customers in those areas. 

This would be of interest to entrepenuers wanting to open a new restuarant, so that they can clearly define the type of restaurant to open based on the current competitive landscape in a given neighborhood.  This will increase the chances of success of such venture, for example, by not trying to open a sushi restaurant in an neighborhood already crowded by such type of restaurant or by incorrectly position a price range depending on the competition on each neighbourhood.
